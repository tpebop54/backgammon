Here's how I'd approach starting your backgammon project:
Phase 1: Core Game Foundation (2-3 weeks)
Start with the web version using Next.js - it's easier to debug and test game logic on desktop:

Set up the basic project structure:
mkdir backgammon-app
cd backgammon-app
npx create-next-app@latest web --typescript --tailwind

Build the core game engine first:

Game state management (board positions, turn logic)
Move validation (legal moves, bearing off rules)
Dice rolling and pip counting
Basic board visualization


Create a simple local multiplayer version (two players on same device)

Phase 2: Real-time Multiplayer (2-3 weeks)

Add Socket.io for real-time gameplay
Set up basic Node.js backend
Implement matchmaking and game rooms

Phase 3: Essential Features (3-4 weeks)

User authentication and profiles
Game history and basic replay system
Doubling cube mechanics

My recommended first steps this week:

Sketch out the game state structure - what data represents a backgammon game?
Build the visual board - just static HTML/CSS to start
Implement basic piece movement - click to select, click to move
Add dice rolling and turn management

Would you like me to create a starter template with the basic board layout and game state structure? I can build a simple interactive board that you can immediately start testing with.
This approach lets you see progress quickly and iterate on the core gameplay before adding complexity.
