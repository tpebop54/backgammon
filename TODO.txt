Phase 1: Core Game Foundation (2-3 weeks)
Set up the basic project structure:
mkdir backgammon-app
cd backgammon-app
npx create-next-app@latest web --typescript --tailwind

4. Add Basic Room/Player Management
Implement matchmaking and game rooms
Allow joining a specific room (for now, just use a default room or a simple room code).
Assign each tab a player color (white/black) or let the user pick.

6. (Optional) Add More Multiplayer Features
Add player names, chat, or a simple lobby.
Add reconnection logic and error handling.





















Phase 3: Essential Features (3-4 weeks)

User authentication and profiles
Game history and basic replay system
Doubling cube mechanics

My recommended first steps this week:

Sketch out the game state structure - what data represents a backgammon game?
Build the visual board - just static HTML/CSS to start
Implement basic piece movement - click to select, click to move
Add dice rolling and turn management

Would you like me to create a starter template with the basic board layout and game state structure? I can build a simple interactive board that you can immediately start testing with.
This approach lets you see progress quickly and iterate on the core gameplay before adding complexity.
